Siteshop, a PHP-based, MVC-inspired Content Management Framework
=============================================================

This is my first tryout in creating a site with som MVC patterns. It is part of
my studies at BTH, Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola, in Sweden and some text may be
written in Swedish.
Most of the content is created by our teacher Mikael Roos.
